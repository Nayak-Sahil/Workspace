# Workspace: Permission-Controlled Collaboration
A platform where **users can collaboratively edit, view, and share content** based on assigned roles.

This project **implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for managing user roles and workspace permissions. It provides users with different levels of access, such as Admin, Editor, and Viewer, to a shared workspace where they can perform actions based on their roles.
